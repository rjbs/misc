#INTRODUCTION: A true Roget's Thesaurus (as opposed to an alphabetically-
#listed synonym dictionary) is composed of three parts:
#     - a hierarchical classification structure (hierarchy or "Synopsis
#       of Categories");
#     - a body, which lists the Categories (whose titles are sometimes
#       referred to as "head words" or "headings"), under which are found
#       the groups of semantically- or conceptually-related words and
#       phrases (synonyms or entries);
#     - an Index, which lists the entries alphabetically (along with the
#       Category titles and numbers under which the entry may be found in
#       the body).
#
#This document contains the complete Index to the 1911 (American) edition.
#It was generated from the entries (synonyms and word lists) contained in
#the Gutenburg/MICRA free E-text thesaurus 15a (plain text version). It
#is larger than the original 1911 thesaurus Index, containing all text
#entries (i.e. excluding numbers, special characters and parenthetical
#information) up to 25 characters long (91,000+ entries).
#
#INDEX ENTRIES: This Index lacks the intelligence found in the original
#hand-edited Index, where common-sense aggregations occur. For example
#A B C and A.B.C. are found under a single Index entry in the original
#Index. Also, phrases are here listed alphabetically, rather than
#"semantically." For example, in the original Index under the Index entry
#'home' there are phrases such as 'be at -', 'at - with', 'bring - to'
#("be at home," "at home with," "bring home to"). In this automatically-
#generated Index 'be at home' is instead listed after the entry 'be at
#cross purposes with' and before the entries 'be at home in', and 'be at
#home with'; while 'bring home to' is listed after 'bring' i.e. none of
#the original group are listed under 'home' but are found instead listed
#alphabetically.
#
#     This Index includes archaic and obsolete words; foreign terms;
#     Latin quotations; and many other such entries, that the average
#     thesaurus-user would never need, and were not included in the
#     original Index.
#
#     Foreign characters such as umlaut, circumflex, grave or acute
#     may be encoded, e.g. flamb_ee. A look-up for these codes is not
#     provided.
#
#Header Page: I have included the original Roget's header page to the
#Index (with its explanatory note) for completeness. However the
#information it gives is not accurate for this automatically-generated
#Index--for words or phrases that are both an Index entry and one of
#the Category names ("headings") listed beneath it, the reference number
#is in fact not printed in bold-face type.

#INDEX
#
#     N.B. The numbers refer to the headings under which the words or
#     phrases occur. When the same word or phrase may be used in various
#     senses, several headings under which it, or its synonyms, will be
#     found, according to those meanings, are indicated by the words
#     printed in Italics. These words in Italics are not intended to
#     explain the meaning of the word or phrase to which they are
#     annexed, but only to assist in the required reference.
#
#     When a number or word of reference is placed within parentheses,
#     the actual word or phrase will not be found under the heading
#     referred to, although it may sometimes be useful to consult the
#     category thus indicated.
#
#     When the word given in the Index is itself the title or heading
#     of the category, the number of reference is printed in bold-face
#     type, thus: abode 186.#
