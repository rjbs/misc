A facet is a tag with a value.

A facet is stringified as "tag:value" and is created by the inclusion of such a
string in the tagstring.

An entry with a value for tag X has tag X.

Given an entry with the facet "tag:value" a user find the entry by querying
for: (1) tags => [ 'tag' ] (2) tags => [ 'tag:value' ]

Facets are stored in the entrytags table.  The table will go from { id, entry,
tag} to { id, entry, tag, value }

An entry may have only one value for a tag. (?)

a tag set is an arrayref of tag names
a facet set is a hashref of tag names as keys and tag values as values; undef
indicates no constraint on value, "" indicates null
