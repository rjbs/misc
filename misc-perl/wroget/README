wroget.schema is a schema dump for your reference.

importer.pl is, unsurprisingly, the flatfile importer script. It
should run with no problems once the "wroget" db is set up.

wroget.xi is the CGI script. It should likewise need no
modifications. I think. Maybe some of the path stuff in the embedded
HTML. It (and importer) is old and shitty code.
