#     In this file, comments which are not a proper part of the thesaurus
#itself are contained within arrow brackets thus: <-- comment -->.
#     Section headings,  which are not an actual part of the thesaurus
#proper, are included between percent (%) markers.
#     Occasional references to numbers starting with "@" are the embryonic
#beginnings of a reorganized version, mentioned below.  A few comments are
#also included within curly brackets {}.

#          ============================================
#
#  The following additional differences will be noted between this version
#and the original edition of the printed 1911 thesaurus:
#  (1) the space-saving abbreviations in the original, using hyphens to
#      represent common words, prefixes or suffixes, have been expanded
#      into the full words or phrases.
#  (2) the side-by-side format for words and their opposites has been
#      abandoned.  Words are listed in order of their entry number.
#  (3) each main entry (1035 entries) has a pound sign "#" in front of
#      the number to facilitate computerized search.
#  (4) Greek words and phrases are transliterated and included between
#      brackets in the format <gr/greek word/gr>.
#  (5) where italics occurred in the original, italics are used in the
#      Microsoft Word format file.  In the plain ASCII file, this
#      formatting is lost.
#  (6) in the original book, words which were obsolete (in 1911) were
#      marked with a dagger.  In this version, those words are marked with a
#      vertical bar ("|").
#      Some of the words which were still current in 1911, but are no longer
#      found in a current college-size dictionary (presently obsolete words),
#      or which are no longer used in the specific indicated sense, have been
#      marked with a bar followed by an exclamation point "|!".  However,
#      this marking process has just commenced, and only a small portion of
#      the words which are now obsolete have been thus marked.  Most though
#      not all of the foreign-language phrases are now obsolete.
#      The "obsolete" notation [obs3] indicates that the previous word (or
#      some word in the previous phrase) is not recognized by the word
#      processor's spelling checker, and also is either NOT in a modern
#      college-sized dictionary, or is noted there as being "ARCHAIC".
#  (7) the approximate location of the bottom of each page in the original
#      1911 printed book is indicated by a comment of the form:
#      <--  p.  23 -->. To search for a page, note that there are two spaces
#      between the "p." and the page number.
#  (8) This file contains only the main body of the thesaurus.  Neither
#      outline nor index are contained here.  The outline with an overview
#      of the organization of the concepts is contained in a separate file,
#      "outline.doc", on the distribution disk.#
#
#     This first edition of this supplemented 1911 thesaurus (June 1991) is
#very much less complete than the latest editions of commercial thesauri,
#and is probably not suitable for use as an adjunct to word-processing
#programs, but it has no proprietary claims attached to it by MICRA, Inc.,
#and does not contain any material published commercially after 1911.
#     Future (copyrighted) versions of this thesaurus are planned, which
#will be reorganized in a hierarchical fashion to maximize the ability to
#take advantage of inheritance of semantic characteristics from higher
#categories.  The objective is to create a database of words organized by
#semantic categories, suitable for use in natural-language understanding
#programs.  This is a very small-scale project, which will not be
#competitive  with large academic or commercial efforts such as the CYC
#project, but is intended to provide a convenient resource for
#experimentation in natural-language processing for individuals or small
#groups.  Anyone who is currently engaged in or contemplating a similar
#thesaurus or dictionary project, who would be willing to collaborate on
#this project, is encouraged to contact us, so that unnecessary duplication
#of effort can be avoided.  We would also appreciate being notified of
#typos, errors, or omissions in any version.  Send inquiries or comments to:
